# 🏥 Decentralized Healthcare Data System

A comprehensive AI-powered and blockchain-secured healthcare platform for disease prediction, patient data privacy, and medical insight generation.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

This project aims to revolutionize healthcare by providing a decentralized system that:

- Predicts major diseases using machine learning
- Stores sensitive health records securely using blockchain
- Provides real-time, accurate, and intelligent health assistance

---

## 🔬 Diseases Covered

1. **🫁 Lung Cancer**
   - Early-stage detection using medical image and symptom analysis
   - Model trained on relevant features (coughing, chest pain, imaging, etc.)

2. **🩸 Diabetes**
   - Predicts Type 1 and Type 2 risks based on clinical and lifestyle features
   - Offers exercise, diet, and medication recommendations

3. **🧬 Kidney Disease**
   - Identifies chronic kidney disorder stages based on test inputs
   - Recommends actions and monitoring

4. **❤️ Heart Disease**
   - Predicts risks using blood pressure, cholesterol, and ECG-like parameters
   - Focused on prevention and doctor connectivity

## 🔐 Blockchain Integration

We use blockchain to:

- Securely store patient medical history
- Ensure tamper-proof, transparent data sharing between hospitals
- Enable patient-controlled access to health records via smart contracts

### Tools:
- Solidity for Smart Contracts
- Ethereum or Polygon for deployment
- Web3.js or Ethers.js for frontend interaction
